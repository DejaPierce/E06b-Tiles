In this program I created a platformer by using tilted map editor. In the platformer you can control an alien in a spaceship by using the left,right, up, and down keys. You score points by collecting the correct star shaped coins. The highest possible score that you can get is 6. Also in this platformer you can jump on the green circle coins to reach certain platforms.
